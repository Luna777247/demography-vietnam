Contributing

Thanks for your interest! To contribute:

1. Fork the repository on GitHub.
2. Create a branch for your changes: `git checkout -b feature/my-change`.
3. Commit changes and open a Pull Request against `main`.

Please keep notebooks and large generated files out of feature branches where possible; add smaller reproducible scripts instead.
